# Website
A place to talk about St. Paul's Website. [This](https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/how-much-should-a-website-cost/) is a great resource talking about the various considerations to take into account when progressing on this project.

## Getting Started
Track all of the decisions and action items in the [:clipboard: Task List](https://github.com/StPaulThorndale/Website/issues). Add new tasks here for vetting by the team if you like. Then, see the progress of each task by opening them individually, or viewing them on the [:bar_chart: Project Board](https://github.com/StPaulThorndale/Website/projects/1).
